    Add phone number and Parmatrised constructor had the block code, hence have called the add_phone_number to the par constructor, used the object created for unsorted type linked list to check the length of the numbers inputed, in the remove phone number function, I have called the object for unsorted type class to see if the phone number I'm removing is the last number of the customer if yes, then I've called the make empty function to delete all the dat of the customer.
